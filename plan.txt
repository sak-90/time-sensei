Building a productivity tracking app like the one you described is a complex project that involves several components. Here's a high-level overview of the tech stack and architecture you can consider:

**Tech Stack:**

1. **Frontend:**
   - React or a similar JavaScript framework/library for building the user interface.
   - HTML/CSS for styling.
   - Redux or Context API for state management.
   - Axios or another HTTP library for making API requests.

2. **Backend:**
   - Node.js with Express.js or a similar framework for the server.
   - MongoDB or a relational database (e.g., PostgreSQL) for storing user profiles, goals, and progress data.

3. **Authentication:**
   - Firebase Authentication or a custom JWT-based authentication system.

4. **AI Integration:**
   - OpenAI API or a similar natural language processing (NLP) service for generating recommended steps.

5. **Calendar Integration:**
   - Google Calendar API or a similar service for connecting to users' calendars.

6. **Notifications:**
   - Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) or a similar service for push notifications.

**High-Level Architecture:**

1. **User Authentication:**
   - Users create profiles and log in using Firebase Authentication or a custom solution.
   - Store user profiles in your database with information such as goals and timeframes.

2. **Goal Setting:**
   - Users input their goals and desired completion times through the app's frontend.
   - This data is stored in the database.

3. **AI Recommendation:**
   - When a user sets a goal, you can use the OpenAI API to generate recommended steps or action plans to achieve that goal within the specified timeframe.
   - Store these recommendations in your database.

4. **Calendar Integration:**
   - Connect to the user's Google Calendar using the Google Calendar API.
   - Schedule and update events or reminders based oent:**
    - Collect user feedback and iterate on the app to improve user experience and add new features.

Please note that building such an app can be a significant undertaking, and
you may need to break it down into smaller tasks and milestones. It's also
essential to prioritize data security and user privacy, especially when
handling user data and integrating with services like Google Calendar.n the
recommended steps and user preferences.

5. **Notifications:**
   - Set up push notifications (e.g., using FCM) to remind users of their
	 tasks and provide updates at specified intervals.

6. **Frontend Development:**
   - Develop a user-friendly frontend where users can view their goals,
   recommended steps, and progres backend.

7. **Backend Development:**
	- Create API endpoints for user registration, goal creation, AI
	recommendations, and calendar integration.
	- Handle data storage and retrieval from the database.
	- Implement user authentication and authorization.

8. **Database:**
	- Store user profiles, goals, recommended steps, and
	progress data in the database.
